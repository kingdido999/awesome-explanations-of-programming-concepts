### Mutex

> For a real-world metaphor of a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at a conference with only one microphone. Before a panelist may speak, they have to ask or signal that they would like to use the microphone. Once they get the microphone, they may talk for as long as they would like, then hand the microphone to the next panelist who requests to speak. If a panelist forgets to hand the microphone off when theyâ€™re finished with it, no one else is able to speak. If management of the shared microphone goes wrong, the panel would not work as planned!
